# MindFlow ðŸš€

A minimal semantic router powered by embeddings & ChromaDB

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

MindFlow is an experimental project that routes user queries to the right action or model by comparing semantic similarity.
Instead of waiting for an LLM to decide, we use embeddings + vector search for fast routing.

## ðŸ”‘ Features

- YAML-based route definitions (config.yml)

- Automatic embedding generation & storage
